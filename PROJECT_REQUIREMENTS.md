# Intelligent Trading Agents - Project Requirements

## 1. Project Overview
A terminal-based, multi-agent AI system that leverages CrewAI to monitor financial news, analyze company data, and execute trades based on predefined criteria using the Alpaca Markets API.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality
- Real-time news monitoring for specified stock tickers
- Automated financial research based on news triggers
- Market sentiment analysis
- Trade decision making based on user-defined criteria
- Automated trade execution via Alpaca Markets API
- Simulation mode for strategy testing
- Performance tracking and reporting

### 2.2 User Interface
- Terminal-based command-line interface (CLI)
- YAML configuration files for trading parameters
- Rich-formatted terminal output for trade history and performance metrics
- Agent decision explanation in terminal logs
- Manual override capabilities via command-line arguments

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Development Stack
- **Interface**: Terminal-based CLI using Typer and Rich
- **Agent Framework**: CrewAI for agent orchestration
- **Storage**: SQLite for historical data, JSON for configuration
- **Containerization**: Single Docker container
- **Deployment**: Local or simple cloud VM

### 3.2 External APIs and Tools
- **Alpaca Markets API**: For trade execution, market data, and real-time news via WebSocket
- **SerperDev API**: For additional web search capabilities (research, context)
- **OpenAI API**: For initial news sentiment analysis
- **CrewAI Tools**: For agent capabilities and web search
- **Custom Tools**: For Alpaca API integration (trading and news)

### 3.3 Performance Requirements
- Real-time news processing via WebSocket (< 5 second delay)
- Initial sentiment analysis using LLM (< 10 seconds)
- Trade execution within 30 seconds of agent decision
- Ability to handle at least 20 watchlist stocks
- Graceful handling of API rate limits

## 4. Development Phases

### 4.1 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Project setup using CrewAI CLI
- YAML configuration structure
- Custom Alpaca WebSocket news monitoring service
- Custom Alpaca trading tool implementation
- Environment variable management

### 4.2 Phase 2: Agent Configuration
- News monitor agent YAML definition
- Research agent YAML definition
- Financial analysis agent YAML definition
- Market context agent YAML definition
- Execution agent YAML definition

### 4.3 Phase 3: Task Configuration
- Define sequential task workflow in YAML
- Implement before_kickoff and after_kickoff hooks
- Set up logging and performance tracking
- Configure agent interactions

### 4.4 Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- Paper trading mode implementation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Strategy refinement
- Documentation

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of agent interactions
- Paper trading validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Configuration validation
